# Minimal coturn configuration for WebDrop
# Docs: https://github.com/coturn/coturn/wiki

# Listening ports
listening-port=3478
# tls-listening-port=5349

# Public IP address of the server (set this!)
# For single-NIC hosts, set to the machine's public IP
# For NAT, set external-ip=PUBLIC_IP/INTERNAL_IP
# Example:
# external-ip=203.0.113.10
# or
# external-ip=203.0.113.10/10.0.0.5

# Authentication realm (domain)
realm=webdrop.local

# Static users (dev/testing). For production prefer dynamic/ephemeral credentials.
# ‘user’ entries can be repeated to add multiple accounts.
# NOTE: Replace with strong secrets or use dynamic auth.
user=${TURN_USERNAME:-webdrop}:${TURN_PASSWORD:-webdrop-secret}

# Recommended security options
fingerprint
no-multicast-peers
no-loopback-peers
no-tcp-relay

# Relay settings
# Total relay ports range (default is wide); uncomment to restrict range
# min-port=49152
# max-port=49999

# Certificates for TLS (optional but recommended in production)
# Uncomment and set the paths to enable turns: on 5349
# cert=/certs/fullchain.pem
# pkey=/certs/privkey.pem

# Verbose logging during setup; reduce later
# verbose
